- provides easier organization of diving events with the aim of connecting users across the coast of the Republic of Croatia
- facilitates development of the user's diving experience
- provides insight into user's personal progress
- enables exchange of diving experiences and useful information

## System feautures
- User login/registration
- Creation and review of localities where diving events such as dives and eco-actions can be organized
- Users can join or create the diving events
- Dives can be private (only invited people can participate) or public (anyone who registers can attend the event, requires the approval of the organizer), while eco-actions are only public
- At the end of the diving event, users have access to the achieved results through their profiles
- Users can become a member of a diving club to find their partners in diving activities or create their own which must be approved by the system administrator

## Used tools and technologies
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ajax, MySQL
- Bootstrap framework - responsiveness, website looks good on all devices (mobile phone, tablet, laptop, Desktop, TV)
- XAMPP - provides local server and PhpMyAdmin (database creation)
- Google API (Google Maps)
- CSS and JavaScript minifier

## Future steps
- Image compression (reduce size without compromising quality, the size of the web page decreases and its loading speed increases)
- Finding web server and getting a domain (test the web page loading speed using GTmetrix and Google PageSpeedInsights)
- Filtering localities by a given parameter
- Displaying a Google map with completed dives on the user's profile
- Ability to rate comments in the localities and printing a certain number of comments with the highest ratings
